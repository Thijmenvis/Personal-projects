#If it's just a substring search you can use:
string.find("substring").

#You do have to be a little careful with find, index, and in though, as they are substring searches. In other words, this:

s = "This be a string"
if s.find("is") == -1:
    print "No 'is' here!"
else:
    print "Found 'is' in the string."

#It would print Found 'is' in the string. Similarly, if "is" in s: would evaluate to True. This may or may not be what you want.

#Basically, you want to find a substring in a string in python. There are two ways to search for a substring in a string in Python.
#Method 1: in operator
#You can use the Python's in operator to check for a substring. It's quite simple and intuitive. It will return True if the substring was found in the string else False.

>>> "King" in "King's landing"
True

>>> "Jon Snow" in "King's landing"
False

#Method 2:
str.find()

#The second method is to use the str.find() method. Here, we call the .find() method on the string in which substring is to found. We pass the substring to the find() method and check its return value. If its value is other than -1, the substring was found in the string, otherwise not. The value returned is the index where substring was found.

>>> some_string = "valar morghulis"

>>> some_string.find("morghulis")
6

>>> some_string.find("dohaeris")
-1

#I would recommend you to use the first method as it is more Pythonic and intuitive.
