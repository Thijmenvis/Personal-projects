__rules for if-statements__

1. every if-statement must have an else
2. if this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must
  use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies,
  just like we did in the last exercise. This will find many errors.
3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep and always try to do them one deep
4. treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping
  is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
5. your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculation
  to variables earlier in your function and use a good name for the variable.

__rules for loops__

1. use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This
  only applies to python; other languages are different.
2. use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed
  or limited number of things to loop over.

__tips for debugging__

1. do not use a "debugger". a debugger is like doing a full-body scan on a sick
  person. You do not get any specific useful information, and you find a whole
  lot of information that doesn't help and is just confusing.
2. the best way to debug a program is to use print to print out the values of
  variables at points in the program to see where they go wrong.
3. make sure parts of your program work as you work on them. Do not write
  massive files of code before you try to run them. Code a little, run a little,
  fix a little.
